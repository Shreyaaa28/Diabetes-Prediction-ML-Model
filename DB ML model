Diabetes Prediction using ML modelling
Objective:
The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can predict the likelihood of an individual developing diabetes based on their 
health metrics and lifestyle factors. The goal is to create a robust and accurate model that can assist healthcare professionals in early diagnosis and
prevention strategies.
The model uses several medical information such as the person's BMI, blood glucose level, and insulin level to make a prediction.

Key Components:

1] Data Collection:
Gather and preprocess a dataset containing various health metrics such as age, BMI, blood pressure, glucose levels, and family history of diabetes. 
The dataset may be sourced from publicly available repositories like the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset or other relevant healthcare datasets.

2]Data Preprocessing:
Clean the data by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numerical features.
Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution of the data and identify any patterns or correlations.

3]Feature Selection:
Select the most relevant features that contribute to diabetes risk. Techniques such as correlation analysis, feature importance from tree-based models,
or dimensionality reduction methods may be used.

4]Model Development:
Train multiple machine learning models including logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and support vector machines (SVM) to predict diabetes risk.
Utilize cross-validation to evaluate model performance and prevent overfitting.

5]Model Evaluation:
Assess the performance of the models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
Compare the performance of different models to select the best one for predicting diabetes risk.

Expected Outcomes:
The project aims to deliver a highly accurate machine learning model capable of predicting diabetes risk with high reliability. 
The final product will include a predictive tool that can be used by healthcare professionals and individuals for early detection and preventive measures.
